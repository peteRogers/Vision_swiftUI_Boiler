# Vision_swiftUI_Boiler
SwiftUI boiler code expanded from tutorial on kodeco [https://www.kodeco.com/19454476-vision-tutorial-for-ios-detect-body-and-hand-pose#toc-anchor-005]
I have found it really difficult to take vision UIKit code from live camera feed that is easy in UIViewController and put it into a SwiftUI based project, but this is my starting point. 

Main thing is it provides an overlay to draw vision detection results on top of the camera feed with all the transform conversions needed to match up points. It therefore is a good place to start experimenting with different vision detection algorithms.
